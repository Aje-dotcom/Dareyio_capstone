    "**Key Findings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Missing Data Analysis**: Several features have significant missing values that need attention:\n",
    "   - Occupation: 29.15% missing\n",
    "   - Previous Claims: 29.15% missing  \n",
    "   - Number of Dependents: 10% missing\n",

    "   - Customer Feedback: 6.58% missing\n",

    "2. **Feature Correlations with Premium Amount**: Surprisingly, the correlations are quite low, suggesting complex non-linear relationships:\n",
    "   - Credit Score: 0.005 (highest correlation)\n",
